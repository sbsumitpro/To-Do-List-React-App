# To Do List App
This is a starter project where using React we are able to create a todolist app. It's a single page application and I am using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos to fetch the sample data


## Features

- Get all the todos from an API call to the UI.
- Add a task to the top of all the todos.
- Delete any task
- One click update option is there.
- A checkbox is there to mark any task as completed
- As the given API has 200 rows of data, I purposely have taken only 20 data using slice method to implement this feature.





## Installation

Install the project with either downloading the zip file or git clone and npm.

```bash
  npm install  
```
```bash
  npm start  
```

    
## Folder Structure

In this project I have created a Component folder inside the src folder. 

I have created 2 components here, they are following

    1.  AddForm
    2.  ToDoList

All the style was written inside index.css file.
